The following parts of the Static and SysLink API (Windows 10) are not used:

Control styles:
---------------
- LWS_TRANSPARENT (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc136543.aspx)
	-> it's not clear how this style has to be used
- SS_BITMAP (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_[BLACK|GRAY|WHITE]FRAME (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> this feature doesn't seem useful nowadays
- SS_[BLACK|GRAY|WHITE]RECT (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> this feature doesn't seem useful nowadays
- SS_CENTERIMAGE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_ENHMETAFILE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_ETCHEDFRAME (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> could be used to create some kind of frame
	-> it seems like overkill to use a non-windowless control for such tasks
- SS_ETCHEDHORZ (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> could be used to create a horizontal 3D line
	-> it seems like overkill to use a non-windowless control for such tasks
- SS_ETCHEDVERT (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> could be used to create a vertical 3D line
	-> it seems like overkill to use a non-windowless control for such tasks
- SS_ICON (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_LEFTNOWORDWRAP (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> this feature doesn't seem very useful
- SS_NOTIFY (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> we don't use the notifications, so we don't need this style
- SS_REALSIZECONTROL (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> requires comctl32.dll 6.0 or newer.
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_REALSIZEIMAGE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_RIGHTJUST (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- SS_SIMPLE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> this feature doesn't seem very useful
- SS_SUNKEN (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> we're using WS_EX_STATICEDGE instead
- SS_USERITEM (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760773.aspx)
	-> seems to be similar to SS_OWNERDRAW

Messages:
---------
- LM_GETIDEALHEIGHT (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760716.aspx)
	-> we're using LM_GETIDEALSIZE instead
	-> could be implemented nevertheless, because it also works with comctl32.dll 6.0, unlike LM_GETIDEALSIZE which requires comctl32.dll 6.10 or newer
- STM_GETICON (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760775.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- STM_GETIMAGE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760778.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- STM_SETICON (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760780.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text
- STM_SETIMAGE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760782.aspx)
	-> currently we support only text

Notifications:
--------------
- STN_CLICKED (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760784.aspx)
	-> we're detecting clicks based on WM_LBUTTONDOWN and WM_LBUTTONUP
- STN_DBLCLK (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760786.aspx)
	-> we're using WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK instead
- STN_DISABLE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787520.aspx)
	-> raising an event if the control is disabled seems like overkill
- STN_ENABLE (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787522.aspx)
	-> raising an event if the control is enabled seems like overkill
